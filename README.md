Application programming project!

About the project:

Turku University of Applied Sciences (TUAS) has a lot of free workspaces after 16 and before 21 o’clock during weekdays. Auditoriums, meeting rooms, classrooms etc. A web service is needed where a client can create or cancel a reservation for a workspace. A client can be anyone, even outside TUAS. It should also be possible to add, edit and delete clients and workspaces into the system. Of course, the clients themselves should not be able to create, edit or change the workspaces. For reasons of privacy, they also should not be able to view, edit or delete the information of the other clients. Listings of clients, workspaces and reservations should be available. The system should watch over that duplicate reservations are not possible. It should also keep record of data creation dates and times, as well as the dates and times of last modifications.
